# Data preparation and transformation exercise

The objective of this exercise is to practice various steps of data preprocessing and feature engineering.

The scenario is the preparation of data for a ML multilinear regressions.

The dataset used is the "Climate Weather Surface of Brazil - Hourly", wich is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region?select=make_dataset.py).

It contains hourly climate data taken from weather stations in Brasil, taken between 2000 and 2021.

Steps:

1. Load data
2. Inspect data
3. Format features
4. Clean messy data
5. Remove duplicate values
6. Treat missing values
7. Imputation
8. Remove strongly correlated features
9. Remove outliers
10. Aggregate features
11. Encode categorical features
12. Feature scaling
13. Dimensionality reduction and feature decomposition
14. Sample and balance
